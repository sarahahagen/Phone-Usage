# Phone-Usage
Final Project for CPSC 222 (Introduction to Data Science) at Gonzaga University for Fall Semester 2020

## Description
The project is about my personal use of my iPhone via the Apple implemented "Screen Time" located in the "Settings" application provided by Apple.  
There are several different categories that "Screen Time" gives and I create code to visualize those categories, run statistical analysis, and run a few supervised machine learning classifiers for my social networking minutes.

## Running the Code
To run the code:
* an API key for IPGeolocation API will be needed toward the beginning.

Otherwise, it should run correctly when needed.

## Organized
The project is organized by the different topics within Data Science:
* Introduction
* Data Analysis
  * Data Preparation
  * Exploratory Data Analysis
    * Visualizations
  * Statistical Analysis
* Classification Results
* Conclusion
